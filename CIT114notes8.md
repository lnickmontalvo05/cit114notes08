RELATIONAL DATABASES 

-Fundamental concepts (relation, table, column, domain, record) 

-Properties of a table (distinct name, no dupe rows, entries in columns are atomic, entries from columns are from the same domain based on data type) 

-Operations combining different data types are not allowed 

-Each attribute has a distinct name 

-Sequence of columns or rows are insignificant

"a command often used would be like this: Select (SELECT * FROM dbo.Orders)"

(The summary I can give would be how effective databases are overall in the tech world, allowing much more ease of access throughout.) 

(New facts I learned were how there are usually only 4 different yet basic commands for queries for data within most databases. Another thing I learned is that technically search engines use different forms of databases.)
